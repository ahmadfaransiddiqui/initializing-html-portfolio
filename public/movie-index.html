<h1>Best movies that I have watched till now that of 21.July.2023</h1>
<h2>My top recommendations</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>The best movie I would say of entire Marvel Cinemetic Universe. It's a bit emotional at the end for someone who is die heart fan of the Marvel superheoes, specially the Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk. Well telling more about it would spoil thje movie if you have not already watched it!.</p>
<h3>The Avatar</h3>
<p>Another Sci-Fi movie and it is a great experice of CGI ever.</p>
<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>Last of my recommendation but nut not the least. The entire series of Sherlock Holmes and even Enola Holmes is a great masterpiece of Mystry and Detective movies.</p>
